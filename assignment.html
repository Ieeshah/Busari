    <h1>Javascript</h1>
    <p>Javascript is a full fledge dynamic programming language that helps us add interactivity to our webpage.</p>
    <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.
        It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.
        After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).
        Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).
        </p>

        <h2>Reserved keywords in JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Abstract</b> - Abstract is a non-access modifier which is applicable for classes, methods but not variables.</li>
            <li><b>Await</b> - The keyword Await makes JavaScript wait until the promise returns a result.</li>
            <li><b>Boolean</b>•	Boolean - Boolean is used as a<u> function</u> to get the value of a variable, object, conditions, expressions, etc. in terms of true or false.</li>
            <li><b>Break</b> - It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the <u>loop</u>.</li>
            <li><b>Byte</b> - This uses the JavaScript typeof() operator to detect what kind of type is variable x and y.</li>
            <li><b>Case</b>- The switch statement evaluates an expression. The value of the expression is then compared with the values of each <b>case</b> in the structure.</li>
            <li><b>Catch</b> - This statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed if an error occurs in the try block.</li>
            <li><b>Char</b> - The char keyword is a data type that is used to store a single character.</li>
            <li><b>Class</b> - Classes are another way of writing constructor functions which can be used in order to create a new object using the new keyword.</li>
            <li><b>Const</b> - The const keyword is used to declare the constant in the function scope.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Var</h3>
        <p>Var declarations were the only type of variables before ES6, and Let and Const were introduced to fix some of its issues. The main differences with Var are its scope, its ability to be re-declared and updated, and the fact that it is hoisted. Now, as far as scope goes, var is globally scoped if it is declared outside of a function, functionally scoped if declared within one. For example:</p>


        function pizzaDecider(){
            var pizza = "delicious"
            };
            
             console.log(pizza);

        <p>If we can redeclare a var that’s globally scoped at any time, one small mistake could ruin otherwise perfectly good code. This is a big reason why let and const are preferred. Another little unique wrinkle about var is the fact that it’s hoisted. I’m not going to go super deep into hoisting, but for our purposes, it’s a pretty simple concept. Take this for example:</p>


        <p>We get undefined instead of an error, because variables declared with var are “hoisted” to the top of their execution context. This is not the case with let or const.</p>


        <p>Let variables, unlike var, is block scoped, which means it scoped to a bunch of code surrounded by curly brackets. This can mean a function, or a loop or what have you. Another difference between let and var is that let can be updated, but not redeclared.</p>


        <p>This is the main difference between let and const. They’re both scoped the same, but const cannot be updated or redeclared whatsoever.</p>


        <p>So just to recap, the main differences are: var declarations are globally or functionally scoped while let and const are block scoped. Var can be updated and redeclared, let can be updated but not redeclared, and const can do neither. Var is hoisted, while let and const are not.</p>
